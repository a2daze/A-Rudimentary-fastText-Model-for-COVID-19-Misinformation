COVID-19 is an illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in late 2019 and quickly spread. It was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization. In May 2023 it was declared that COVID-19 is no longer a public health emergency of international concern. However, the virus continues to circulate in communities and remains a potentially serious risk to health. Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary in severity from asymptomatic to:
fever
cough
general weakness or fatigue
a change in or loss of taste or smell
sore throat
headache
muscle pains
diarrhoea
The most severe cases can lead to shortness of breath due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, as well as other complications, potentially leading to death. 
The groups most likely to develop severe disease are:
People over 60 years
Pregnant women
People with underlying health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc.
Most people infected with COVID-19 have asymptomatic or mild to moderate respiratory illness and can recover without needing special treatment. 
Some people may experience long-term effects from SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as "long COVID-19." This condition can affect people of all ages, including those who initially had mild symptoms. 
SARS-CoV-2 spreads mostly through respiratory droplets that carry the virus, coming straight from someone infected, who sneezes, coughs, talks, sings, or even just breathes near other people. Virus-containing particles can be inhaled or deposited in the nose and mouth or on the eyes.
Although the virus can survive on some surfaces for up to several days, the amount of viable virus declines over time and it is rarely present in sufficient amounts to cause infection after a few days.
Transmission from one infected person to another can start two days before the infected person even begins to show symptoms. In addition, it usually takes five to six days for someone to start showing symptoms after being infected. However, this can vary from one day to two weeks.
The most effective way to prevent COVID-19 is vaccination. There are currently 8 vaccines authorised by the European Union.  COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be very effective in reducing the risk of infection and severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The main treatment for most patients with severe disease is  supportive care, which is often highly effective, and antiviral medication (monoclonal antibodies and/or available antiviral drugs) where appropriate.
In addition to vaccination, there are other ways to protect ourselves and others and reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus such as:
If you are experiencing symptoms, there are also measures to avoid infecting the others:

BNT162b2 vaccine booster and mortality due to COVID-19. Arbel et al. NEJM (December 8, 2021). 
Key findings:
Methods: Analysis of electronic health record data for 843,208 adults aged ≥50 years in Israel who were eligible for 3rd dose of BNT162b2 (had received 2 doses ≥5 months previously) during August–September 2021 and had no prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. HRs were assessed using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model and were adjusted for coexisting conditions and demographics. Limitations: Brief follow-up period (54 days); participants aged >60 years were eligible for boosters in the first 2 weeks of the study period, and younger participants were eligible thereafter, leading to possible overestimation of mortality in the booster group; findings are limited to the BNT162b2 vaccine.
Implications: A BNT162b2 booster was associated with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death due to COVID-19 among adults ≥50 years of age. These findings support COVID-19 booster recommendations for persons in this age group.

Note: Adapted from Arbel et al. Cumulative HR for death due to COVID-19. The shaded area indicates the 95% CI. Individuals were assigned to the no booster group from the start of the study (August 6, 2021) until 7 days after receiving a booster dose, at which point they were re-assigned to the booster group for the remainder of the follow up period.

Nursing home staff vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes. McGarry et al. NEJM (December 8, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Using U.S. national COVID-19 nursing home data, nursing homes (n = 12,364, 81% of all US nursing homes) were classified into quartiles by staff vaccination coverage and county prevalence of COVID-19 from June-August 2021. Outcomes among the lowest and highest quartiles were compared using multivariate regression models with adjustment for resident vaccination rates, previous COVID-19 infection rates among staff and residents, facility characteristics, and county as a fixed effect. Limitations: Data limited to nursing homes that reported vaccination rates for the week ending June 13 and reported outcomes in each week of the study period.
Implications: High vaccination coverage among nursing home staff can prevent COVID-19 cases and deaths among nursing home residents in communities with high prevalence of disease. These findings emphasize the importance of vaccination among staff in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.

Protection and waning of natural and hybrid COVID-19 immunity. Goldberg et al. medRxiv (December 5, 2021). Published in NEJM (June 9, 2022).
Key findings:
Methods: Rates of infection in Israel per 100,000 person-days were calculated using Poisson regression analysis using data from the Israel Ministry of Health from August–September 2021 (n > 5.7 million). Limitations: Study measures observed rate of infection which could be affected by detection bias; effect could be confounded by different variants circulating over time; duration of immunity from booster is not known.
Implications: Immunity from SARS CoV-2 infection appears to wane more slowly than immunity conferred from a 2-dose vaccination series, findings similar to Kim et al. A booster dose of vaccine appears to restore at least short-term protection in previously vaccinated people.

Note: Adapted from Goldberg et al. Estimated covariate-adjusted rates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100,000 person-days stratified by immunity-inducing event and time since most recent event (vaccine or infection) for (A) recovered (unvaccinated, previously infected individuals), (B) vaccinated (individuals who received 2 vaccine doses and had no history of infection) and booster (individuals who received 3 doses of vaccine and had no history of infection), and (C) hybrid immunity individuals (previously infected individuals who subsequently received a single vaccine dose [Rec then Vacc] and individuals who received 1 or 2 vaccine doses and were subsequently infected [Vacc then Rec]).

Two studies evaluated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in sera from vaccinated persons.
A. Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant by vaccine sera and monoclonal antibodies. Wilhelm et al. medRxiv (December 11, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Neutralization efficacy against live Omicron and Delta isolates was assessed using sera collected from 117 participants of previous studies who were vaccinated and had sera collected at 0.5, 3, or 6 months after most recent vaccine dose. Limitations: Small sample size; single isolate of Omicron variant used.
Figure:

Note: Adapted from Wilhelm et al. Antibody-mediated neutralization efficacy against authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta and Omicron among persons vaccinated with BNT162b2 (A) or mRNA-1273 (B). Values represent reciprocal dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 variant microneutralization titers resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NT50). Percentages are the percentage of samples that achieved a measurable titer. Numbers over brackets are fold-differences in NT50 values for Delta vs. Omicron. Black dotted line represents limit of detection. 2x BNT (6m): 2 doses of BNT162b2, 6 months after vaccination (n = 15). 2xBNT/BNT (0.5m): 3 doses of BNT162b2, 0.5 months after 3rd dose (n = 12). 2xBNT/BNT (3m): 3 doses of BNT162b2, 3 months after 3rd dose (n = 20). 2xBNT/infection: 2 doses of BNT162b2 and a previous SARS CoV-2 infection (n = 20). 2xMOD (6m): 2 doses of mRNA-1273, 6 months after vaccination (n = 14). 2xMOD/BNT (0.5m): 2 doses of mRNA-1273 with a booster dose of BNT162b2, 0.5 months after booster (n = 9).

B. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron has extensive but incomplete escape of Pfizer BNT162b2 elicited neutralization and requires ACE2 for infection.  Cele et al. medRxiv (December 7, 2021). Published in Nature as Omicron extensively but incompletely escapes Pfizer BNT162b2 neutralization (December 23, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Plasma collected a median of 24 days post-vaccination from individuals in South Africa with (n = 6) or without (n = 6) previous infection were tested for neutralization activity against Omicron and D614G using live virus neutralization assay. Limitations: Small sample size; single Omicron isolate tested; findings are limited to the BNT162b2 vaccine.
Figure:

Note: Adapted from Cele et al. Neutralization of the Omicron variant compared to D614G ancestral virus among BNT162b2-vaccinated participants with or without history of prior infection with D614G SARS-CoV-2. Red dashed horizontal line denotes most concentrated plasma tested. Numbers in black above each virus strain are geometric mean titers (GMT) of the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50), which is the inverse of the plasma dilution required for 50% reduction in infection focus number. Number in red denotes fold-change in GMT between D614G and Omicron. **p=0.0018 as determined by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Licensed under CC-BY-ND 4.0.
Implications for Wilhelm et al. and Cele et al.: The Omicron variant appears to be less susceptible to current COVID-19 vaccine- and infection-induced neutralizing antibodies. This effect appears to be attenuated in vaccinated persons with a previous history of infection and in persons who recently received a 3rd (booster) dose of vaccine.

An upper bound on one-to-one exposure to infectious human respiratory particles. Bagheri et al. PNAS (December 7, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Mathematical modeling to determine upper bound of transmission risk from an infectious to susceptible individual under various masking and distancing conditions. Modeling calculations included respiratory particle size and dynamics, mask penetration and leakage, pathogen concentration produced by an infectious individual, and susceptibility of the uninfected individual. Limitations: Upper bound risk assessment is conservative and may overestimate actual infection risk; does not assess risk in real-world conditions.
Implications: These findings indicate that face mask use among infectious and susceptible individuals significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection risk compared with physical distancing alone; level of protection varies by type of mask worn and the fit by both the infectious and susceptible individual.

Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 disease incidence independent of comorbidities, among people with HIV in the US. Ignacio et al. medRxiv (December 8, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 during March–December 2020 among 16,056 PWH in routine care was calculated using Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) data. Risk factors were assessed using relative risk regression models adjusted for disease risk scores. Limitations: Lack of systematic testing, resulting in potential misclassification and potential ascertainment bias.
Implications: These findings indicate that structural racial and gender inequities, in addition to medical comorbidities, might increase the risk of COVID-19 among PWH.

Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection associated with emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa. Pulliam et al. medRxiv (December 2, 2021). Published in Science (March 15, 2022).
Key findings:
Methods: Retrospective study of reinfection among 2,796,982 persons in South Africa with laboratory-confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 tests collected through a national surveillance system from March 4, 2020–November 27, 2021. Risk of primary infection, reinfection (sequential positive RT-PCR or antigen tests ≥ 90 days apart), and relative hazard of reinfection vs. primary infection were calculated. Limitations: Vaccination status of reinfected individuals was not known; detection rates may vary across time and by characteristics related to access to testing; hazard ratio only uses 2nd infection as reinfections; model does not account for potential of waning immunity; antigen testing may be under-reported in the data set.
Implications: The Omicron variant appears to increase the risk of reinfection, suggesting it might have increased ability to evade immunity from prior infection. More research is needed to determine if similar results are seen for vaccine-induced immunity.

COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in New York State. Rosenberg et al. NEJM (December 1, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Prospective cohort study of New York state residents (n = 8,690,825), aged ≥18 years; weekly hazard rates were estimated by vaccine, product, age, and timing of vaccination cohort for VE against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (May 1–September 3, 2021) and COVID-19 hospitalization (May 1–August 31, 2021). Limitations: Indirect effects (e.g., herd immunity) and effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infections were not assessed.
Implications: COVID-19 VE against hospitalization remains high despite the emergence of the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, but declining VE among adults ≥65 years of age underscores the importance of prioritizing this group for vaccine boosters.

Viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants in vaccinated and unvaccinated. Kissler et al. NEJM (December 1, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: SARS-CoV-2 specimens (n = 19,941) obtained from 173 infected National Basketball Association participants from November 28, 2020–August 11, 2021. Viral dynamics among participants infected with Alpha (B.1.1.7 [n = 36]), Delta (B.1.617.2 [n = 36]), and non-VOI/VOC (n = 41), and among fully vaccinated (n = 37) and unvaccinated (n = 136) were compared using Bayesian hierarchical modeling. Limitations: Small sample size prevented sub-analysis; participants were mostly healthy young men; Ct values were used to determine viral genome equivalents thus indirectly measuring viral loads; metric used to determine clearance of acute infection was not defined; findings might not be generalizable.
Implications: In this study, fully vaccinated individuals had a shorter period (2-days less) from peak viremia to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection than unvaccinated persons. While additional research on differences in viral dynamics is needed, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across all variants.

Third COVID-19 vaccine dose boosts neutralizing antibodies in poor responders. Lake et al. medRxiv (December 2, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: SARS-CoV-2 NAb levels were measured in adults aged 18–80 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 (n = 180) or mRNA-1273 (n = 89). 23 VPRs received a 3rd vaccine dose 1–8 months (mean 5 months) after their 2nd dose. NAbs (reported as percent neutralization) were detected by lateral flow assay at 2–4 weeks and 2–4 months post-2nd dose, and at 1–2 weeks prior to 3rd dose and 2–4 weeks post-3rd dose. Limitations: Small sample size for VPRs; variability in administration of 3rd dose (manufacturer, timing); measured only antibodies to RBD that can be captured by ACE2 receptor on a lateral flow assay.
Implications: Persons fully vaccinated with an mRNA-based vaccine but with lower SARS-CoV-2 NAb capacity can elicit a robust immune response after a 3rd dose.

Risk of COVID-19 hospital admission among children aged 5–17 years with asthma in Scotland: A national incident cohort study. Shi et al. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (November 30, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Analysis of linked data of children aged 5–17 years enrolled in the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) cohort study in Scotland from March 2020–July 2021 (n = 752,867). Limitations: Small absolute numbers of COVID-19 hospital admissions; surrogate markers were used to classify poorly controlled asthma.
Implications: Children with asthma, especially those with recent history of asthma hospitalization or multiple courses of steroids for asthma exacerbations, are at elevated risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination and other prevention measures.

COVID-19 trends and severity among symptomatic children aged 0-17 years in ten EU countries, 3 August 2020 – 3 October 2021. Bundle et al. medRxiv (November 29, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Analysis of pooled weekly surveillance data of COVID-19 symptomatic children aged 0-17 years (n = 820,404) reported by 10 European Union countries (Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovakia, and Sweden) from August 2020–October 2021. Hospitalization associated with comorbidities was estimated for 7 countries only. Limitations: Data on vaccination status of the children were not available; data restricted to symptomatic cases.
Implications: Risk of hospitalization and severe COVID-19 outcomes are higher among children with a potential comorbidity; CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for persons ages 5 years and older and emphasizes use of multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies to protect children <5 years of age.

Transmission potential of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in a federal prison, July—August 2021. Salvatore et al. medRxiv (November 19, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Analysis of 978 nasal specimens serially collected from 95 incarcerated persons (78 received a primary series of an approved or authorized vaccine [“fully vaccinated”]) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection July–August 2021. Duration of PCR positivity and viral culture positivity were assessed using survival analysis. Limitations: Small sample sizes underpower the statistical comparisons of vaccination status; potential misclassification of history of infection if not documented in Bureau of Prison medical system; results might not be generalizable.
Implications: Unvaccinated and vaccinated persons had similar duration of culturable virus suggesting similar transmission risks. In congregate settings like prisons, mitigation strategies, such as mask wearing and ventilation, should be applied when persons become infected with SARS-CoV-2 regardless of vaccination status.

Antibody titers before and after booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in healthy adults. Demonbreun et al. medRxiv (November 21, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Fingerstick dried blood spot specimens were collected from adults previously fully vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series (n = 33) before and 6–10 days after booster dose administration (mean 237.9 days after last dose). Antibody (anti-RBD IgG) and surrogate virus neutralization (spike-ACE2 receptor interaction) results were compared to results from a prior community-based study that used the same protocols to quantify antibody responses after diagnosis of COVID-19 or administration of COVID-19 vaccine. Limitations: Small sample size; lack of stratification by mRNA vaccine type and long-term immune response assessment.
Implications: In this study, mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters augmented immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 among individuals already vaccinated against and/or exposed to SARS-CoV-2. CDC now recommends that everyone ages ≥18 years should receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster.

Durability of anti-spike antibodies in the infant after maternal COVID-19 vaccination. Shook et al. medRxiv (November 20, 2021). Published in JAMA as Durability of anti-spike antibodies in infants after maternal COVID-19 vaccination or natural infection (February 7, 2022).
Key findings:
Methods: Cross-sectional study in Massachusetts that included 90 pregnant participants who received COVID-19 vaccination and 12 pregnant participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Matched maternal and umbilical cord sera were collected during the delivery hospitalization, and liveborn infants of enrolled pregnant participants were enrolled after birth. Specimen collection was in summer and early fall 2021. Limitations: Small sample size; race/ethnicity data unavailable; breastfeeding not assessed.
Implications: COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy resulted in a higher proportion of infants with detectable antibodies for at least 6 months. Findings support COVID-19 vaccination recommendations for people who are pregnant and suggest that protection might extend to their unvaccinated infants.

Reduced incidence of long-COVID symptoms related to administration of COVID-19 vaccines both before COVID-19 diagnosis and up to 12 weeks after. Simon et al. medRxiv (November 18, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: A retrospective study of persons with COVID-19 (n = 240,648) during February 2020–May 2021 was conducted using electronic health records and claims data. Long COVID cases were defined as persons who received medical care for ≥1 COVID-associated symptom 12–20 weeks after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. ORs were based on logistic regression and adjusted for demographics and underlying health conditions. Limitations: Conducted before the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became predominant; does not evaluate vaccine product.
Implications: COVID-19 vaccination, when administered before or shortly after a COVID-19 diagnosis, might protect against symptoms of long COVID.
 
Figure: 

Note: Adapted from Simon et al. Odds of long COVID symptoms were lower among vaccinated persons (stratified by timing of vaccination) relative to persons who remained unvaccinated up to 12 weeks after diagnosis.

Long COVID after breakthrough COVID-19: The post-acute sequelae of breakthrough COVID-19. Al-Aly et al. Research Square (November 15, 2021). Published in Nature Medicine as Long COVID after breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection (May 25, 2022).
Key findings:
Methods: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs electronic health records data were used to determine risk of death and risk of ≥1 post-acute sequela among persons with a documented first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result after COVID-19 vaccination (“breakthrough,” n = 16,035) compared with persons with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result with no prior COVID-19 vaccination (n = 48,536), and a control group with no positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (n = 3,569,525) during February–October 2021. HRs were adjusted for demographics and health characteristics. Limitations: Veterans not representative of the general U.S. population; infection status of persons who were not tested might be misclassified.
Implications: People with SARS-CoV-2 infections appear to be at risk for long-term sequelae during the 6 months following infection. COVID-19 vaccination might reduce, but not eliminate, these risks.
Figure: 

Note: Adapted from Al-Aly et al. Risk and 6-month excess burden of post-acute sequelae, by organ system, among people with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with unvaccinated infected persons.

Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 against SARS-CoV-2 household transmission: A prospective cohort study in England. Clifford et al. medRxiv (November 25, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: During February–September 2021, adult index cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their household contacts were identified from community testing data; participants used self-testing kits to take oral-nasal swabs on days 1, 3, and 7 after enrollment that were tested by RT-qPCR; Bayesian logistic regression models were adjusted for age, vaccination history, and variant. Limitations: Limited power to detect differences in VE; did not assess or adjust for possible waning vaccine immunity relative to the circulation of the two variants; unable to assess VE among younger age groups (persons aged <18 years were not eligible for vaccination at the time).
Implications: COVID-19 vaccination was effective in reducing household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although protection might be lower against Delta than Alpha variants.
Two studies evaluated COVID-19 mortality in the United States by race, ethnicity, and education.
PEER-REVIEWED
A. Variation in COVID-19 mortality in the US by race and ethnicity and educational attainment. Feldman et al. JAMA Network Open (November 23, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Cross-sectional study determined COVID-19 cumulative mortality among all persons aged ≥25 years in the United States in 2020 (n = 219 million) using open access data provided by CDC. Mortality was determined in subgroups jointly stratified by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. Limitations: Data could be subject to misclassification of race, ethnicity, or cause of death; unable to assess potential modifiers (e.g., geography) or changes in mortality over time.

B. Social class, race/ethnicity, and COVID-19 mortality among working age adults in the United States. Pathak et al. medRxiv (November 24, 2021). Published in International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health as Joint effects of socioeconomic position, race/ethnicity, and gender on COVID-19 mortality among working-age adults in the United States (April 30, 2022).
Key findings:
Methods: U.S. age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate study among adults aged 25–64 years by social class, race and ethnicity, and gender during 2020 using the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) ad hoc death certificate tabulation in February 2021. Educational attainment was used as a surrogate marker for social class. Limitations: Death certificate data might underreport COVID-19 mortality, with variation in accurate reporting over time.
Figure: 

Note: Adapted from Pathak et al. COVID-19 mortality rates and social class-gender-race/ethnicity disparity rate ratios among Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, and White men and women aged 25–64 years, United States, 2020.

Evaluation of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age. Walter et al. NEJM (November 9, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Ongoing phase 2–3 safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy trial of BNT162b2 vaccination in healthy children aged 5–11 years. Children were randomly assigned to receive either two 10 µg doses of BNT162b2 21 days apart or placebo; 1,517 received BNT162b2 and 751 received placebo. Vaccine efficacy was assessed ≥7 days after dose 2. Immune responses 1 month after dose 2 were immunologically bridged to those of 16–25-year-old participants from the pivotal trial of 2 BNT162b2 30 µg doses. Limitations: Short duration of follow up (median 2.3 months); study likely under-powered to detect rare adverse events.
Implications: Two 10 µg doses of BNT162b2 vaccine were safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in children 5–11 years of age.

Note: Adapted from Walter et al. Panel A shows the cumulative incidence of the 1st occurrence of COVID-19 after BNT162b2 dose 1 or placebo. Each symbol represents cases of COVID-19 on a given day. Panel B shows systemic events reported within 7 days after vaccine dose 1 (n = 1,511) and dose 2 (n = 1,501) and placebo (dose 1, n = 748 or 749; dose 2, n = 740 or 741 [number of children reporting at least 1 “yes” or “no” for the event after each dose]). Bar colors refer to adverse event severity: mild, moderate, severe, grade 4. Numbers above bars are percentage of participants in each group. I bars represent 95% CIs.

Distinct SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity patterns elicited by natural infection and mRNA vaccination. Assis et al. NPJ Vaccines (November 4, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Samples were obtained from 2 ongoing COVID-19 longitudinal serological surveys of Orange County, CA residents (July and December 2020) and healthcare workers (May and December 2020–March 2021) and a hospital biorepository of samples from 93 hospitalized patients. IgG levels were determined using a multiplex antigen microarray containing antigens from SARS-CoV-2. Limitations: Unclear severity and timing of participants’ infections and timing of vaccination; SARS-CoV-2 exposure may have differed between groups; specimens collected during pre-Delta period.
Implications: mRNA vaccination appears to induce a broader antibody response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Three doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination are safe based on adverse events reported in electronic health records.Niesen et al. medRxiv (November 9, 2021). Published in JAMA Network Open as Surveillance of safety of 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination using electronic health records (April 14, 2022).
Key findings:
Methods: Retrospective study of patients vaccinated with 3 doses of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer/BioNTech, n = 38,094) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna, n = 9,905), December 1, 2020–October 17, 2021. Electronic health records were used to identify adverse events in the 2 weeks prior to the 1st dose and 2 weeks following the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd doses. Limitations: Limited to signs/symptoms included in electronic health records; persons who experienced post-vaccine adverse events might be less likely to get subsequent doses; results may not be generalizable.
Implications: The risk of severe adverse events after a 3rd dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is low and comparable to the risk after a 2nd dose.

Note: Adapted from Niesen et al. Prevalence of vaccine-associated adverse events in 3-dose vaccinated individuals during the 14-day period before 1st dose, after 1st dose, after 2nd dose, and after 3rd dose in (a) individuals that received 3 doses of BNT162b2, and (b) individuals that received 3 doses of mRNA-1273. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals, and asterisks indicate adverse events with significant (two-tailed p-value <0.05) difference in prevalence after the 3rd dose, compared with before the 1st dose (blue asterisk) or after the 2nd dose (orange asterisk).

Burdens of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 by severity of acute infection, demographics and health status. Xie et al. Nature Communications (November 12, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients who tested positive March 2020–March 2021 (n = 181,384) and uninfected controls (n = 4.4 million) using Veterans Health Administration data. Outcomes ascertained from 30 days after infection until the end of follow-up. Burden defined as having conditions in excess of the uninfected control group; models adjusted for multiple factors, including comorbid conditions. Limitations: Predominantly male participants; burdens may be underestimated if conditions not recorded in medical records; findings might not be generalizable.
Implications: Post-COVID conditions encompass a wide range of syndromes and likely pose significant challenges to patients and the U.S. healthcare system.
Figure:

Disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status: A systematic-review and meta-analysis. Magesh et al. JAMA Network Open (November 11, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 68 U.S. based-studies (>4 million individuals) that were published January 1, 2020–January 6, 2021. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Metaregression conducted to evaluate adjusted associations. Limitations: Race/ethnicity data missing for large proportion (~40%) of individuals; incomplete data for several racial and ethnic groups prevented inclusion of these groups in some analyses; many studies lacked variables of interest; susceptible to biases of included studies.
Implications: Even after correction for demographic and socioeconomic factors, COVID-19 positivity and ICU admission varied by race/ethnicity. Socioeconomic and racial inequities should be factored into efforts to reduce COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

Supporting health equity through data-driven decision-making: A local health department response to COVID-19. Hansotte et al. American Journal of Public Health (October 28, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Trends of COVID-19 cases and tests over time were examined in relation to dates testing sites were opened, March 2020–January 2021. Limitations: Non-experimental design and no control of confounding factors, findings might not be generalizable to other populations.
Implications: A data- and community-based, integrated intervention by local public health partners may contribute to more equitable access to COVID-19 testing.

PEER-REVIEWEDAssociation of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with risk of breakthrough infection following mRNA vaccination in Qatar. Abu-Raddad et al. JAMA (November 1, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Matched-cohort study (n = 617,268), Qatar, December 2020–September 2021. Each individual with prior infection matched by sex, 5-year age group, nationality, and calendar week of 1st vaccine dose to 3 individuals without prior infection. Incident infection was determined ≥14 days post-2nd vaccine dose. Limitations: Only PCR-confirmed infections included; may not be generalizable to specific age groups or to U.S. population.
Implications: Among persons fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to provide additional protection against breakthrough infections.
Figure:

Association between mRNA vaccination and COVID-19 hospitalization and disease severity. Tenforde et al. JAMA (November 4, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Case-control analysis of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 21 hospitals, United States, March–July 2021 (n = 1,187). Outcomes of fully vaccinated persons at 28 days compared to those of unvaccinated persons, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities. Patients considered fully vaccinated 14 days after 2nd mRNA vaccine dose. Limitations: Limited to hospitalized patients, did not assess out-of-hospital deaths; sample size limited assessment by vaccine type, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and time since vaccination; some data accrued prior to Delta period.
Implications: Breakthrough infections following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination among hospitalized patients were less severe than SARS-CoV-2 infections among unvaccinated persons hospitalized for COVID-19. These findings support prior data that COVID-19 vaccination can reduce COVID-19 severity and mortality.
Figure:

Note: Adapted from Tenforde et al. Cumulative incidence of hospital discharge by vaccination status (fully vaccinated with a 2-dose series of mRNA vaccine vs. unvaccinated) is shown for patients who are A) not immunocompromised, B) immunocompromised, C) aged 18 to 64 years, and D) aged 65 years or older. The event of interest was discharge from the hospital before day 28 in the presence of the competing event of death. Patients who remained hospitalized more than 28 days were censored at 28 days. Competing risk models were adjusted for age group (18–49, 50–64, and ≥65 years), sex, self-reported race and ethnicity, and number of medical comorbidities. Models by age group were adjusted for continuous age in years. SHR = subdistribution hazard ratio. Reproduced with permission from JAMA, 2021.

Two Israeli studies evaluated the effectiveness of a 3rd dose of the BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine.
A. Effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for preventing severe outcomes in Israel: An observational study. Barda et al. The Lancet (October 29, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Retrospective cohort study of persons who were eligible to receive 3rd vaccine dose during July–September 2021, Israel. Cohort assembled using data from a large healthcare organization. Persons who received a 3rd dose were matched — on age, sex, place of residence, comorbidities, 2nd dose timing, and number of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests — to persons who received 2 doses. Limitations: Excluded high-risk population groups (immunocompromised persons who received a 3rd dose prior to July 30, 2021 recommendation for the general public [aged >60 years] to receive a 3rd dose, healthcare workers, and those in long-term care facilities or medically confined to their homes); small number of events in some age groups limits ability to calculate age-based estimates; relatively short follow-up period (maximum of 55 days).

Methods: Retrospective cohort study of members of a health management organization who had no evidence of infection prior to the study period (July–October 2021), Israel (n = 947,131). VE rates were adjusted using a GLM model for age group, gender, socioeconomic status, population group, and religiosity and 10-day calendar period. Limitations: Persons >60 years were overrepresented among persons receiving the 3rd dose; asymptomatic infections may have been undetected; VE of younger age groups not reported; relatively short follow-up period (maximum of 70 days).
Implications for Barda et al. and Saciuk et al.: A 3rd dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine appears to provide added protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19-related outcomes compared to 2 doses.
Association between vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and Bell’s palsy: A population-based study. Shibli et al. The Lancet Regional Health–Europe (November 3, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Retrospective cohort study of >2.4 million individuals aged ≥16 years and vaccinated during December 2020–April 2021, using data from a large health system in Israel. SIRs calculated by dividing observed incidence after vaccination by expected incidence (incidence during January–May 2019) and weighted for age and sex. Limitations: No concurrent comparison group; adverse events not systematically collected; causal link not established.
Implications: BNT162b2 vaccination might be associated with a small increase in risk of Bell’s palsy, particularly among those with previous Bell’s palsy. However, the risk of Bell’s palsy following vaccination is low. More studies are needed, especially in older women and those who previously experienced Bell’s palsy.

Impact of Delta variant and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 secondary attack rate among household close contacts. Ng et al. The Lancet Regional Health–Western Pacific (November 1, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Retrospective cohort study in Singapore (September 2020–May 2021) determined secondary attack rates by variant type and vaccination status (n = 1,024 household contacts linked to 301 PCR-confirmed index cases). Limitations: Infection of contacts from non-household sources cannot be excluded; pre-symptomatic (when interviewed) persons may have been misclassified as asymptomatic; unable to adjust for comorbidities.
Implications: Delta variant appears more transmissible among household contacts than other variants. Vaccination might not prevent individuals with breakthrough Delta variant infection from transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to their household contacts, but prior vaccination of exposed household contacts appeared to lower their risk of becoming infected.
PREPRINTS (NOT PEER-REVIEWED)Social vulnerability and rurality associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced seroprevalence: A nationwide blood donor study, United States, July 2020–June 2021. Li et al. SSRN (November 2, 2021). Published in Clinical Infectious Diseases (February 7, 2022).
Key findings:
Methods: National blood donor seroprevalence study, United States, July 2020–June 2020. >1.5 million specimens tested for anti-S antibodies and anti-N antibodies to distinguish infection-induced from vaccine-induced antibodies. Associations of seroprevalence with race/ethnicity, rurality, and county-level social vulnerability modeled with multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender and county. Limitations: Blood donors not representative of general population; counties approximated from ZIP codes.
Implications: Infection-induced antibody seroprevalence data can complement case-based surveillance data. Rural counties and counties with low socioeconomic status may warrant prioritization for vaccination and other public health efforts.

Membrane fusion and immune evasion by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. Zhang et al. Science (October 26, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: S protein functional characteristics of G614, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Kappa variants were assessed by binding, fusion, and pseudovirus assays using primarily ACE2, HEK-293 cells, and monoclonal antibodies. Limitations: No in vivo model; did not confirm with full-length authentic viruses.
Implications: The Delta variant has an in vitro advantage due to its spike protein that rapidly fuses with cells for entry, using low levels of ACE2 receptor. The relative ease of cellular entry may contribute to the Delta variant’s efficient person-to-person transmissibility and worldwide expansion.

COVID-19 breakthrough infections and pre-infection neutralizing antibody. Yamamoto et al. medRxiv (October 25, 2021). Published in Clinical Infectious Diseases as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) breakthrough infection and post-vaccination neutralizing antibodies among healthcare workers in a referral hospital in Tokyo: A case-control matching study (December 24, 2021)
Key findings:
Methods: Matched case-control study conducted within longitudinal serological study, Japan. Cases (n = 17) and controls (n = 51) were matched on multiple factors, including worksite, sex, age, and time interval between the 2nd vaccination and blood specimen collection. Pre-infection neutralizing antibodies and anti-spike antibodies were assessed 5–10 weeks before infection. Limitations: Small sample size; antibodies might have waned before infection.
Implications: Neutralizing antibody titers did not distinguish between susceptibility or immunity to breakthrough infections in this small study. These data support CDC guidance, which does not currently recommend antibody testing to assess for immunity following COVID-19 vaccination.

Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection following high-risk exposure. Andrejko et al. medRxiv (October 23, 2021). Published in Clinical Infectious Diseases (December 21, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Case-control study among persons (643 cases and 204 controls) with molecular SARS-CoV-2 test results reported to California Department of Public Health during February–September 2021 and who reported a high-risk exposure (social contact with a person known or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection) within 14 days prior to testing. Predictors of positive tests assessed using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Limitations: Vaccination coverage was low, and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was not widespread during study; type of masks used not reported; underpowered to make certain comparisons.
Implications: Masks and vaccination significantly reduce the risk of infection in real world settings.

Community transmission and viral load kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the UK: a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study. Singanayagam et al. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (October 29, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Prospective longitudinal cohort study, United Kingdom, September 2020–September 2021. SARS-CoV-2 household transmission risk was evaluated by vaccination status for 231 contacts (aged ≥5 years) exposed to 162 epidemiologically linked Delta variant-infected index cases. Limitations: Only symptomatic index cases were recruited; young household members unlikely to have been vaccinated.
Implications: Vaccination of household contacts may provide modest protection against household transmission of the Delta variant. However, fully vaccinated individuals with Delta variant infection can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to vaccinated and unvaccinated household contacts.

Post COVID-19 in children, adolescents, and adults: Results of a matched cohort study including more than 150,000 individuals with COVID-19. Roessler et al. medRxiv (October 22, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Cohort study using health insurance data; each COVID-19 patient (11,950 children aged 0–17 years and 145,184 adults with COVID-19 in 2020) matched to 5 controls based on age, sex, and propensity score on prevalent medical conditions, Germany. 96 pre-defined outcomes were aggregated into 13 diagnosis/symptom complexes and 3 domains. Limitations: Short follow-up duration; might not be generalizable to the United States; persons with undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections could have been misclassified as controls.
Implications: Post COVID-19 morbidity affects both children/adolescents and adults and indicates extended healthcare needs.

COVID-19 vaccination mandates and vaccine uptake. Karaivanov et al. medRxiv (October 25, 2021). Published in Nature (June 2, 2022).
Key findings:
Methods: Variation in timing of provincial mandates (August 5 to September 21, 2021) allowed for a difference-in-differences model to determine the average effect of announcing vaccination mandates on 1st dose vaccine uptake in 9 Canadian provinces. Counterfactual simulations and time-series analyses were used to separately estimate the effect on uptake in each province and in France, Italy, and Germany. Limitations: Estimates may change as more data becomes available; cannot prove causality.
Implications: COVID-19 vaccination mandates appear to have a large but short-lived effect on 1st dose uptake.

In-person schooling and associated COVID-19 risk in the United States over spring semester 2021. Wiens et al. medRxiv (October 23, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Weighted analyses of US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) data, administered with Facebook using 2-stage sampling (n = 1,082,733 respondents living with school-aged children). Survey elicited demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, test results, vaccination, and schooling for any children in the household. Primary outcomes included CLI, loss of taste and/or smell, and positive test results in the past 24 hours. Limitations: Data were self-reported and subject to recall bias; unclear validity of respondents’ description of school policies and adherence to mitigation strategies; CLI is subjective; may not be representative of U.S. population.
Implications: School-based mitigation measures appear to reduce transmission risk associated with in-person schooling and are important steps for protection of the health of students and school staff.

Vaccinating adolescents and children significantly reduces COVID-19 morbidity and mortality across all ages: a population-based modeling study using the UK as an example.external icon Shiri et al. Vaccines (October 15, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Estimates were based on an age-stratified, deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) compartmental model that assessed vaccination impact in the United Kingdom during July–December 2021 in the setting of a return to pre-pandemic social mixing levels. Sensitivity analyses included varying Reff and vaccination coverage. Limitations: Model estimates might not apply to United States; changes in inputs will change outcomes.
Implications: Vaccinating adolescents and children provides direct benefits to those groups and may also provide indirect benefit by reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, morbidity, and mortality among other age groups.
COVID-19 mRNA vaccines drive differential antibody Fc-functional profiles in pregnant, lactating, and non-pregnant womenexternal icon. Atyeo et al. Science Translational Medicine (October 19, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Cohort study of 84 pregnant persons, 31 lactating persons, and 16 non-pregnant women aged 18–45 years, December 2020–February 2021. Serum specimens collected after 1st or 2nd doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines (and after both in a subset). SARS-CoV-2-specific anti-spike protein antibodies were assessed. Limitations: Small sample size; antibody responses in different gestational stages not examined; specimen collection timing after 2nd dose was different by vaccine; some patients contributed a specimen at single time point; immunologic indicators of protection from infection or disease are not yet established.
Implications: Pregnant and lactating persons may have modest immunological responses after the 1st dose of an mRNA vaccine but appear able to mount robust responses after the 2nd dose. Receipt of both primary series vaccine doses is critical for protecting the health of pregnant and lactating persons.

Immunogenicity of standard and extended dosing intervals of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccineexternal icon. Payne et al. Cell (October 15, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Prospective cohort study of healthcare workers who received BNT162b2, United Kingdom, December 9, 2020–May 23, 2021. A small subset was longitudinally assessed for antibody, B cell, and T cell responses. Limitations: Only BNT162b2 studied; small sample size; immunologic indicators of protection from infection or disease are not yet established.
Implications: Longer durations between 1st and 2nd doses of an mRNA primary series might enhance post-vaccination immune responses in those who have not been previously infected.

Impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants on mRNA vaccine-induced immunity.external icon Lucas et al. Nature (October 11, 2021). 
Key findings:
Methods: Serostudy of isolates from the Yale SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance program and clinical specimens from vaccinated healthcare workers (15 previously infected and 17 naïve), November 2020–January 2021. Immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain, variants of concern/interest, and select lineages with key spike gene mutations were assessed. Limitations: Small sample size; immunologic indicators of protection from infection or disease are not yet established.
Implications: Post-vaccination neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants appear to be diminished but still provide neutralization capacity in fully vaccinated persons. COVID-19 vaccination remains critical.

Short-term and long-term rates of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infectionexternal icon. Groff et al. JAMA (October 13, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Systematic review of 57 studies that included 250,351 COVID-19 survivors (79% were hospitalized for COVID-19) evaluated for 38 PASCs occurring 30 days–6 months after acute infection. Limitations: Meta-analysis not performed; may not be representative of patients with mild COVID-19 or patients from middle-to-low income countries; lack of standardized PASC definition; lack of standardized PASC reporting.
Implications: PASC (also called post-COVID conditions or “long COVID”) appear to be common following COVID-19 infection, may significantly affect survivors’ health, and may place an additional burden on healthcare systems.

Assessment of cognitive function in patients after COVID-19 infectionexternal icon. Becker et al. JAMA Network Open (October 22, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Cross-sectional study of post-COVID-19 cognitive functioning (mean 7.6 months [SD 2.7] after acute infection) among adults (mean age = 49 years) with no history of dementia. Validated neuropsychological measures used; impairment defined as a z-score of ≤ 1.5 SD below the age-, educational level-, and sex-adjusted norms. Limitations: Sample may not be representative; lack of non-COVID-19 comparison group limits ability to attribute causality to COVID-19 (as opposed to potential effects from severe illness or hospitalization).
Implications: The substantial proportion of patients with cognitive impairment several months after COVID-19 highlights the importance of continued efforts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce severe disease.

Quantifying and benchmarking disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rates by race and ethnicityexternal icon. Reitsma et al. JAMA Network Open (October 20, 2021).
Key findings:
Methods: Cross-sectional estimation of relative vaccine uptake, defined as observed share of vaccinations for a racial or ethnic group divided by the expected share of vaccinations (at least 1 dose and proportional to group size), as of March 31, 2021. Vaccination scale-up modeled by census tract under 3 scenarios: (1) continuation of observed disparities; (2) equal uptake by racial and ethnic groups (equalized uptake); and (3) equalized uptake + geographic prioritization. Limitations: Vaccine uptake measured during early phase of vaccine roll-out; incomplete race and ethnicity reporting in state vaccination data; racial and ethnic groups with fewer than 200,000 people in a state not included.
Implications: Modeling data suggest that reducing disparities in vaccine uptake might be achieved by geographic prioritization and group tailoring of vaccine promotion efforts.

CDC and its partners are actively monitoring reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination. Active monitoring includes reviewing data and medical records and evaluating the relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.
Information about CDC’s ongoing study of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination can be found here: Investigating Long-Term Effects of Myocarditis | CDC
Myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. In both cases, the body’s immune system causes inflammation in response to an infection or some other trigger.
Symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis:
Most patients with myocarditis or pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination responded well to medicine and rest and felt better quickly.
Seek medical care if you or your child have any symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination.
Healthcare Providers: For additional recommendations and clinical guidance, visit Clinical Considerations: Myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines.
Yes. CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines are the best way to protect you or your child from severe COVID-19 illness, hospitalization and death. The benefits of vaccination outweigh any known risks. For more information, please refer to CDC’s Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States.
If you have concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, talk with your healthcare provider or your child’s doctor, nurse, or clinic.
If you have any health problems after vaccination, report them to VAERS.

COVID-19 vaccine recommendations have been updated as of October 3, 2023 to add 2023-2024 updated Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. The content on this page will be updated to align with the new recommendations. Learn more.
At the April 19, 2023 meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, CDC presented data related to further analyses of a preliminary safety signal for persons ages 65 years and older who received the updated (bivalent) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in one safety monitoring system, the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). Other safety monitoring systems have not observed similar findings. As time has passed and more safety data have accumulated, the initial finding has decreased, and scientists believe factors other than vaccination might have contributed to the initial finding. The current evidence does not support the existence of a safety issue. FDA and CDC will continue to evaluate data as they are available and update the public as needed.
Some people have no side effects. Many people have reported side effects—such as headache, fatigue, and soreness at the injection site—that are generally mild to moderate and go away within a few days.
Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. It has occurred at a rate of approximately 5 cases per one million vaccine doses administered. Anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction, can occur after any kind of vaccination. If it happens, healthcare providers can effectively and immediately treat the reaction. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.
CDC scientists have conducted detailed reviews of cases of anaphylaxis and made the information available to healthcare providers and the public.
Multiple factors contribute to reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination, including heightened public awareness of COVID-19 vaccines, requirements under FDA authorization for COVID-19 vaccines that healthcare providers report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS (even if it is unclear whether the vaccine was the cause), and reporting requirements in CDC vaccine provider agreements. People receiving COVID-19 vaccines are less likely to die from COVID-19 and its complications and are at no greater risk of death from non-COVID causes, than unvaccinated people.
CDC scientists and partners have performed detailed assessments of deaths after COVID-19 vaccination and made the information available to healthcare providers and the public.
GBS is a rare disorder in which the body’s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS has largely been observed among people ages 50 years and older.
Based on an analysis of data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), the rate of GBS within the first 21 days following J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination was found to be 21 times higher than after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination. After the first 42 days, the rate of GBS was 11 times higher following J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. The analysis found no increased risk of GBS after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccination.
Similarly, CDC found higher than expected rates of GBS reported to VAERS after J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination but not after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. These observations contributed to the preferential recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to use mRNA COVID-19 vaccines over the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, which is no longer available in the United States.
CDC and FDA will continue to monitor for and evaluate reports of GBS occurring after COVID-19 vaccination and will share more information as it becomes available.
Myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. Most patients with myocarditis or pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination responded well to medicine and rest and felt better quickly, and most cases have been reported after receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
To date, evidence indicates that the benefits of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risk of myocarditis. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor for and evaluate reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination. Learn more about myocarditis and pericarditis, including clinical considerations, after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.
Data from VSD and from VAERS indicate that rates of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are highest among males in their late teens and early 20s, usually following the second dose of the vaccine.
CDC scientists have conducted detailed reviews of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccines and have made the information available to healthcare providers and the public.
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been rarely observed after J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination and has occurred in approximately 4 cases per one million doses administered. TTS is a rare but serious adverse event that causes blood clots in large blood vessels and low platelets (blood cells that help form clots).
A review of reports indicates a causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and TTS. This observation contributed to the preferential recommendation by ACIP to use mRNA COVID-19 vaccines over the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, which is no longer available in the United States.
CDC scientists have conducted detailed reviews of TTS cases and have made the information available to healthcare providers and the public.

COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines has been rigorously monitored and evaluated since their emergency use authorization (EUA) in December 2020. The updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for 2023-2024 are manufactured using a similar process to the previous vaccines. 
Learn more about EUAs in this video.
As with all vaccines authorized or approved for use in the U.S., CDC, FDA and other federal agencies will continue to closely monitor the safety of the updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines using multiple vaccine safety monitoring systems and will share information with the public as it becomes available.
Some people have side effects after COVID-19 vaccination, while others might have no side effects. Side effects tend to be mild, such as soreness at the injection site and fever, and should go away within a few days. Learn more about common side effects after COVID-19 vaccination.
In rare cases, people have experienced more significant adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination. Any health problem that happens after vaccination is considered an adverse event. An adverse event can be caused by the vaccine or can be caused by a coincidental event not related to the vaccine, such as an unrelated fever, that happened following vaccination.
COVID-19 vaccination continues to be the best way to protect against serious illness. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks. CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other federal agencies continue to monitor the safety of the updated COVID-19 vaccines and will share information with the public as it becomes available.  
Have you experienced a side effect following COVID-19 vaccination?
Please report it to VAERS. In addition, enrolling yourself or your dependent in V-safe allows you to easily report to CDC how you are feeling after getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

For healthcare providers: Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 Treatment and Pre-exposure Prophylaxis in Outpatients
Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help feel better.
If you have COVID-19 and are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, treatments are available that can reduce your chances of being hospitalized or dying from the disease. Medications to treat COVID-19 must be prescribed by a healthcare provider or pharmacist and started within 5–7 days after symptoms appear. Contact a healthcare provider right away to determine if you are eligible for treatment, even if your symptoms are currently mild.
Don’t delay: Treatment must be started within 5–7 days of when you first develop symptoms.
People who are more likely to get very sick include:
Staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccinations makes you much less likely to get very ill, be hospitalized, or even die from COVID-19. Treatments can further reduce the risk for COVID-19 hospitalization and death among vaccinated people, especially those at higher risk for severe illness. A healthcare provider will help decide whether treatment is right for you. Check with your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are taking other medications to make sure the COVID-19 treatments can be safely taken at the same time.
FDA has authorized or approved several antiviral medications used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in people who are more likely to get very sick.

Some treatments might have side effects or interact with other medications you are taking. If you don’t have a healthcare provider, visit a Test to Treat location or contact your local community health center or health department.
If you are hospitalized, your healthcare provider might use other types of treatments, depending on how sick you are. These could include medications to better recognize and respond to the virus, treat the infection, reduce an overactive immune response, or treat COVID-19 complications.
If you have a weakened immune system, have received antiviral treatment, and continue to experience COVID-19 symptoms, your healthcare provider may recommend additional treatment, including convalescent plasma.
COVID-19 rebound is a return of symptoms or a new positive test 3-7 days after recovering from the initial illness, or after having tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. People may experience rebound whether they received COVID-19 antiviral treatment or not. Rebound symptoms are typically mild.
Studies suggest there is no increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness in people who experience COVID-19 rebound after antiviral treatment.
The benefits of COVID-19 treatment outweigh the risk of rebound if you are at high risk for severe COVID-19. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you may have rebound. If you don’t have a healthcare provider, visit a Test to Treat location or contact your local community health center or health department.

COVID-19 oral antiviral treatments Paxlovid and Lagevrio are available on the commercial market. Patient assistance programs are available to people who are underinsured, uninsured, or on Medicaid or Medicare to lower their out-of-pocket costs. You should enroll in these programs to learn if you can receive assistance for specific medications, regardless of your insurance status. Call ahead to your healthcare provider and insurer to confirm coverage eligibility.
The right medications for COVID-19 can help. But people have been seriously harmed and even died after taking products not approved or authorized for use to treat or prevent COVID-19, even products approved or prescribed for other uses. Talk to your healthcare provider about taking medications to treat COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States effectively protect people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and even dying. As with vaccines for other diseases, you are protected best when you stay up to date. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may get additional doses of updated COVID-19 vaccines. People aged 65 and older should receive 1 additional dose of an updated COVID-19 vaccine. CDC recommends that everyone who is eligible stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines.
FDA has authorized a preventive monoclonal antibody for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, ages 12 years and older, and weighing at least 88 pounds. In addition to vaccination, Pemivibart (Pemgarda™) may provide another layer of protection against COVID-19 and can be given at least 2 weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
A healthcare provider gives Pemgarda as a single intravenous infusion over 60 minutes at a doctor’s office or healthcare facility. If continued protection is needed, additional doses should  be administered every 3 months.
People who are privately insured or have Medicare part B may receive Pemgarda for free. Talk to your healthcare provider to see if Pemgarda is right for you.
